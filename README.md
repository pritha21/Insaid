# Context about the dataset

The Haberman's survival dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

Attribute Information:
1. Age of patient at time of operation (numerical)
2. Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical)
3. Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)
4. Survival status (class attribute) 1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer 2 = the patient died within 5 year


# Domain Knowledge

As axillary lymph nodes are near the breasts, they are often the first location to which breast cancer spreads if it moves beyond the breast tissue.

After a breast cancer diagnosis, a doctor will often check whether cancer cells have spread to the axillary lymph nodes. This can help confirm the diagnosis and staging of the cancer.
 
If the lymph nodes feel enlarged, it’s likely the cancer has spread. However, if the lymph nodes don’t feel enlarged, it doesn’t mean the nodes are negative (cancer-free).

The pathologist checks the nodes under a microscope. Nearly one-third of women with negative lymph nodes based on a physical exam have nodes with cancer found during the pathology exam. And, some women with enlarged nodes during a physical exam have cancer-free nodes.
